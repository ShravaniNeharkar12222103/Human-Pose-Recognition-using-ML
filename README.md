# Human-Pose-Recognition-using-ML
This project focuses on real-time human pose estimation using deep learning models such as MediaPipe BlazePose and OpenPose. The goal is to detect and track key body joints in real-time from video input. Pose estimation has various applications in fitness tracking, motion analysis, healthcare, surveillance, and augmented reality.
